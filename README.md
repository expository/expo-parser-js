js-tdd-boilerplate
==================

Boilerplate project for JavaScript Test-Driven Development. Inspired by: <https://dfkaye.github.io/2014/03/04/tdd-boilerplate/>.

The idea:

  - Clone/fork this project as a starting point for new pure-JS code. It's set up to run the same tests against Node.js and browsers.
  - Periodically update this template project as tooling and techniques evolve.
